						2. PlatForm Independent 
			=====================================================
=>A PlatForm is nothing but Type of OS being Used for Running OR Execution of Applications OR Programs.
-----------------------------------------------------
Definition of OS(Operating System)
-----------------------------------------------------
=>OS is one of the System Software which acts as Resource allocattion Manager during the Program Execution and also acts as Resource De-allocattion Manager after completion of the Program Execution.
					OR
=>The OS is one the Interface Between Program and Computer Hardware (Resources).
=>Here Resources Represents  Main Memory (RAM) , Processor (CPU), Secondary Memory (Hard Disk ), Input Ouput Devices (Keyboard, Moniter..etc)...etc
----------------------------------------------------------------
=>In IT , we have Two Types of Programming Languages. They are

			1.  PlatForm Dependent  Languages
			2.  PlatForm Independent Languages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Platform Dependent Lanuages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>In Platform Dependent Lang, Data Types differes from One OS to Another OS and and These Lang are PLATFORM DEPENDENT.
Example:   C,C++....etc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Platform Independent Language
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>In Platform Independent Lang, The Memory Space taken by Data Types  remains Same on All Types OSes.
=>In Effective Platform Independent Lang, all types of Values will store in the form of OBJECTs and they can store 
   Un-Limited amount of data
=>Hence java Object contains Size Restricted and Memory space Restricted where Python Objects contains Un-limited Size and unlimited values can store.

NOTE:	IN PYTHON ALL VALUES ARE STOREd IN THE OF OBJECTS.
Examples:   Java, PYTHON
