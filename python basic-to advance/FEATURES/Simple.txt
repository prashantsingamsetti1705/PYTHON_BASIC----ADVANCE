				==================================================
								1. Simple 
				==================================================
=>Python Programming Language is one of the SIMPLE Programming Language bcoz of 3 Important Technical Factors.
*****************************************************************
Factor-1
*****************************************************************
=>Python Programming Provides "Rich set of MODULES". 
=>So that Python Programmer can Re-Use the Pre-Defined Code from Pre-Defined Modules and Completes the Task in 
   Real Time in Limited Span of Time.
=>Examples:   math, random, calendar,os,threading,csv,json...etc
---------------------------------
Definition of Module
---------------------------------
=>A Module is a Collection of DATA MEMBERS , FUNCTIONS  and CALSS NAMES.
=>To verify the Documentation of any module, we use help()
=>help(module name)
*****************************************************************
Factor-2
*****************************************************************
=>Python Programming Provides User-Friendly Syntaxes.
=>So that Python Programmer Can develop Error-Free Programs in Limited Spane of Time.
*****************************************************************
Factor-3
*****************************************************************
=>Python Programming Programming Provides In-Built Facilty Called "Garbage Collector".
=>So that "Gabage Collector Collects Un-Used Memory space and Improves the Performance of Python Based 
   Applications. 
=>Hence Garbage Collector Takes care about Automatic Memory Management.
***************************************
Define Garbage Collector:
***************************************
=>A Garbage Collector is one of the In-Built Python Background Program which is running along with Regular Python whose Role is to collect un-used memory space and Improves the Performnace of Python Based Applications.
