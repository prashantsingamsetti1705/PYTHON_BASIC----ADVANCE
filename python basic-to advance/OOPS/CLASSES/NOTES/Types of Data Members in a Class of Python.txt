				=====================================================
					Types of Data Members in a Class of Python
				=====================================================
=>In a class of Python, we can defined Two Types of Data Members. They are

			1. Instance Data Members
			2. Class Level Data Members
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Instance Data Members
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Instance Data Members are those whose memory space created Each and Every Time when an Object is Created 
    and hence Instance Data Members are also called Object Level Data Members.
=>Instance Data Members are Used for Storing Specific Values ( differs from one object to another object).
=>Programatically Instance Data Memebrs can be specified in 3 Places.
				i. through an Object
				ii. Inside of Instance Method
				iii. Inside of Constructor
=>Instance Data Members are Must be accessed w.r.t Object Name  OR self
				objectname.Instance Data Member Name
						OR
				self.Instance Data Member Name (To be used inside of Instance Method Name)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Class Level Data Members
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Class Level Data Members are those whose memory space created Only Once Irrespective Number of Objects are 
    created w.r.t Corresponding Class.
=>Class Level  Data Members are Used for Storing Common Values  for all the Objects of Same Class.
=>Programatically Class Level Data Members can be specified in 3 Places.
				i. Inside the Class Definition
				ii. Inside of Class Level Method
				iii. In Main Program
=>Class Level Data Members are Must be accessed w.r.t Class Name  OR cls OR Object Name  
				classname.Class Level Data Member Name
						OR
				cls.Class Level Data Member Name (To be used inside of Class Level Method Name)
						OR
				ObjectName.Class Level Data Member Name
