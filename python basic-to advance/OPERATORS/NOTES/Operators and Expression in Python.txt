						Operators and Expression in Python
			==========================================================
=>An Operator is a Symbol, which is used to perform Certain Operation on Data OR Values OR Objects (Variables).
=>If two OR More Variables Connected with an Operator then It is called Expression.
=>In Otherwords, An Expression is a Collection of Variables Connected with an Operator.
=>In Python Programming, we have 7 Types of Operators. They are

			1. Arithmetic Operators
			2. Assignment Operator
			3. Relational Operators (Comparision Operators)
			4. Logical Operators (Comparision Operators)
			5. Bitwise Operators--MOST IMP
			6. Membership Operators
					a) in Operator
					b) not in Operator
			7. Identity Operators
					a) is Operator
					b) is not Operator

NOTE1: Python Does not support Unary Operator Like ++ and -- (Pre and Post Incr / Decr)
NOTE2: Python Does not Support Ternary Operator of C,C++, Java , C#.net Lang ( ? : )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE3: Python Have Its Own Ternary Operator called " if....else Operator ".
NOTE4: Python Supports Short Hand Operators such as += , -= , /= , *=  ,  >>= , <<=.....etc
