					5. Bitwise Operators--MOST IMP
			====================================================
=>The Purpose of Bitwise Operators is that "To perform the Operation on Binary Data in the form of Bit by Bit".
=>The  Bitwise Operators are applicable only on Integer Data But not on Floating Point Values bcoz Integer Data gives 
    Certainity where as floating point values does not provide Certainity.
=>The Execution Process of Bitwise Operators is given bellow,
			i)  The bitwise operators Converts the Integer data into Binary Format.
			ii) On Binary Data, Bitwise Operation Performed depends type of Bitwise Operator and Result is 
			     available in the memory in the form of Binary Data
			iii) Since Python Programming Lang is High Level, Automatically The result of Bitwise Operation (Binary 
			      Data ) is displayed in the form of Decimal Number System.
=>Since the Bitwise Operations are Performing on Binary data in the form of Bit by Bit and hence they named as 
   Bitwise Operators.
=>In Python Programming, we have 6 Types of Bitwise Operators. They are given in the following Table.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		SLNO			SYMBOL			MEANING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		1				<<				Bitwise Left Shift Operator
		2				>>				Bitwise Right Shift Operator
		3.				|				Bitwise OR Operator
		4.				&				Bitwise AND Operator
		5.				~				Bitwise Complement Operator
		6.				^				Bitwise XOR Operator
