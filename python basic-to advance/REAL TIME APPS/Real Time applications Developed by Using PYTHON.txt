				Real Time applications Developed by Using PYTHON
			============================================================
=>By using PYTHON Programming Language with Supporting Technologies and Tools, we develop the following Real Time Applications.
		1. Development of Web Applications ( Web Sites )
				i) By Using Java Programming Lang---------->Tech:JDBC, Servlets,JSP, Spring, Spring with micro		(Sun MS Sys---->Oracle Corp)				Serverces, Spring Boot..etc
				ii) By Using C#.net Programming Lang------->Tech: ASP, ASP.Net, ASP with Micro services...etc
					(Micro Soft INC USA)
				iii) By using PYTHON Programming Lang---->Tech : Django, Flask, Pyramid, Bottle..etc
						Less Lines of code and Gives More Meaning Bcoz of MODULES
