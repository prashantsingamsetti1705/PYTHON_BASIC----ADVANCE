					Introduction to Network Programming in Python
				==================================================
=>The Purpose of Networks is that "To Share the Data between Multiple Devices which are located either in Same 
    Network or in Different Network across the Universe".
------------------------------------
Definition of Network:
----------------------------------
=>A Network is a Collection of Inter-connected Autonomous Computeres Connected with Server.
------------------------------------
=>To Share the Data between Multiple Devices , the multiple devices must be in network.
=>In Networking, we can develop Two Types of Programs. They are

				1. Server Side Program
				2. Client Side Program
---------------------------------------------------
Definition of Server Side Program:
---------------------------------------------------
A Server Side Program is one which is used for Receving the Request from Client Side Program, Process the Request and Gives Response Back to Client Side Program.
------------------------------------------------------
Definition of Client Side Program:
---------------------------------------------------
A Client Side Program is one which makes the Request to the Server Side Program and Obtains the Result from Server Side Program.
---------------------------------------------------
Definition of DNS ( Domain Naming Service)
---------------------------------------------------
=>A DNS is a Name of the Physical Machine where the Server Side Program Resides.
=>The Default DNS of Every Computer is "localhost".
---------------------------------------------------
Definition of IP Address ( Internet Protocol Address)
---------------------------------------------------
=>IP Address is a Four Digit Numerical Address of  Physical Machine where the Server Side Program Resides.
=> The Default IPAddress of Every Computer is 127.0.0.1 (Loop Back Address).
---------------------------------------------------
Definition of Port Number
---------------------------------------------------
=>A Port Number is one of the Logical Numerical ID where Server Side Program is Running.
---------------------------------------------------
=>Hence Any Client Side Program want to communicate with Server Side Program then Client Side Program Must Establish the CONNECTION from Server Side Program by passing (DNS/IP Adrress, portno).
